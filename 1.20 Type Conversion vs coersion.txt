Type Conversion means manually convert from one type to another.

'1991'+18 => 18 will be converted to string. will print 199118.

Convert 1991 to number using Number('1991');

Type Coersion means JS automatically converts it for us

log('My age is '+'23') // My age is 23 as string
log('23'-'10'-3)// 10 string converted to number

log(2+3+4+'5') //'95' will be the output
log(10-5-2+'5') //'35' as + is happening
